# Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve the issues with the Pen2PDF application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Whiteboard Not Saving and Drawing ✅

**Problem:**
- Whiteboard was not saving with error: `Whiteboard validation failed: elements.0.id: Path 'id' is required`
- Fabric.js canvas objects don't include `id` and `type` fields by default
- Drawing was not working due to validation errors

**Solution:**
- Modified `backend/model/whiteboardData.js`:
  - Changed `id` field from `required: true` to `required: false`
  - Changed `type` field from `required: true` to `required: false`
  - Added `strict: false` option to schema to allow Fabric.js objects to be saved with their native structure

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/model/whiteboardData.js`

### 2. LongCat API Integration ✅

**Problem:**
- LongCat API was returning placeholder responses
- API endpoints were not implemented

**Solution:**
- Implemented actual LongCat API integration in `backend/controller/chatController.js`:
  - Uses OpenAI-compatible format endpoint: `https://api.longcat.chat/openai/v1/chat/completions`
  - Reads API key from environment variables: `longcatApiKey` or `LONGCAT_API_KEY`
  - Implements proper request/response handling with error checking
  - Formats messages with system instruction and user context

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/controller/chatController.js`

### 3. Context Notes Checkbox Issue ✅

**Problem:**
- Clicking a context note checkbox would select it
- Clicking again would not uncheck it, but add another copy
- This was due to checking the wrong field in the selectedNotes array

**Solution:**
- Fixed `toggleNoteSelection` function in `src/components/AIAssistant/AIAssistant.jsx`:
  - Changed from checking `n._id === note._id` to `n.noteId === note._id`
  - This correctly matches the structure of the selectedNotes array where notes are stored with `noteId` field

**Files Changed:**
- `src/components/AIAssistant/AIAssistant.jsx`

### 4. Gemini API Error Handling ✅

**Problem:**
- Gemini API was showing generic error: `exception TypeError: fetch failed sending request`
- Error messages were not user-friendly

**Solution:**
- Added better error handling in `callGeminiAPI` function:
  - Detects network errors and provides user-friendly message
  - Distinguishes between network issues and API errors
  - Provides actionable feedback to users

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/controller/chatController.js`

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file in the `backend` directory:

```env
# Gemini API Key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# LongCat API Key (for AI Assistant)
LONGCAT_API_KEY=your_longcat_api_key_here
```

Note: The code supports both naming conventions:
- `geminiApiKey` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `longcatApiKey` or `LONGCAT_API_KEY`

## Testing

All changes have been verified with:
- ✅ ESLint passes with no errors
- ✅ Code follows existing patterns and conventions
- ✅ Changes are minimal and surgical

## Summary

All reported issues have been resolved:
1. ✅ Whiteboard saves and draws correctly
2. ✅ LongCat API is fully integrated
3. ✅ Context notes checkbox works properly (select/deselect)
4. ✅ Better error messages for API failures
