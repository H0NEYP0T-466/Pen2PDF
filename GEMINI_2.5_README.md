## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Q: Which model should I use?

### Q: What if I keep hitting quota limits?
**A:** 
1. Switch to Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite (lower cost)
2. Use LongCat models (free alternative)
3. Wait for quota to reset (usually hourly/daily)
4. Consider upgrading API plan

### Q: Do LongCat models still work?
**A:** Yes! LongCat models are completely unchanged and work exactly as before.

### Q: Can I use files with LongCat?
**A:** No, file uploads only work with Gemini models.

### Q: What if server crashes?
**A:** It shouldn't! If it does, please report the error. The new error handling should prevent all crashes.

### Q: How do I switch back to old models?
**A:** Just update the model arrays in `gemini.js` and `notesgemini.js` to use old model names.

### Q: Are there "Lite" versions?
**A:** Yes! `gemini-2.0-flash-lite` is available as a lightweight option.

### Q: What's the difference between "latest" and "002"?
**A:**
- `-latest`: Always uses newest stable version (auto-updates)
- `-002`: Specific stable version (locked)
