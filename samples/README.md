- Screenshots showing UI interfaces

### Key Improvements Validated

✅ **Minimal Margins**: Reduced from 28pt+ to 12mm (34pt) on all sides
✅ **Word Break Prevention**: No words split across lines
✅ **Smart Pagination**: Headings stay with content, tables don't split
✅ **Watermark**: "~honeypot" appears in bottom-right corner
✅ **Typography**: Proper orphan/widow control with 2-line minimum

### Technical Implementation

- **CSS Controls**: `word-break: keep-all`, `hyphens: none`, `break-inside: avoid`
- **Margin Settings**: `@page { margin: 12mm }` and `padding: 8mm`
- **Watermark**: Fixed position with 0.2 opacity
- **Page Breaks**: Smart avoidance for headings, tables, images, code blocks
