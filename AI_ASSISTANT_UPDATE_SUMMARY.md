# AI Assistant Models Update - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend: GitHub Models Registry (`backend/github-models/registry.js`)

**Changes:**
- Removed model discovery from GitHub API (removed import of `discovery` module)
- Replaced comprehensive model catalog with a curated list of 10 verified working models
- Models now hardcoded instead of fetched from API

**Models Included:**
1. gpt-4o (OpenAI)
2. gpt-4o-mini (OpenAI)
3. gpt-5 (OpenAI) - NEW
4. o1-mini (OpenAI)
5. llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct (Meta)
6. llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct (Meta)
7. mistral-large-2411 (Mistral)
8. mistral-small (Mistral)
9. mistral-nemo (Mistral)
10. phi-4 (Microsoft)

**Models Removed:**
- o1-preview
- All Claude models (Anthropic)
- All Gemini models (Google)
- llama-3.3-70b-instruct
- llama-3.1 models (405b, 70b, 8b)
- mistral-large (kept 2411 version only)
- All Cohere models
- All AI21 Labs models
- All Phi-3.x models (except phi-4)

### 2. Backend: GitHub Models Controller (`backend/github-models/controller.js`)

**Changes:**
- Added support for `contextNotes` parameter (same as LongCat/Gemini models)
- Added system instruction for Isabella AI assistant (same as LongCat/Gemini models)
- Implemented context notes processing to prepend note content to user messages
- Fixed variable scope issue with `processedMessages`
- Added handling for both string and multipart content when adding context

**System Instruction Added:**
```
You are Isabella, a helpful AI assistant integrated into the Pen2PDF productivity suite. 
You help users with their questions, provide insights from their notes, and assist with 
various tasks. Be concise, helpful, and friendly.
```

**Context Notes Implementation:**
- When notes are selected, they are formatted as:
  ```
  Context from notes:
  
  --- Note Title ---
  Note content
  ```
- This context is prepended to the user's message before sending to the AI model
- Works with both text-only messages and multipart messages (text + images)

### 3. Frontend: AI Assistant (`src/components/AIAssistant/AIAssistant.jsx`)

**Changes:**
- Added `contextNotes` to GitHub Models API call
- Now sends selected notes as context (same as legacy models)
- Notes are serialized as JSON and sent via FormData

**Code Added:**
```javascript
// Add context notes (same as legacy models)
if (selectedNotes && selectedNotes.length > 0) {
  formData.append('contextNotes', JSON.stringify(selectedNotes));
}
```

## Testing Results

### Model Registry Test
✅ All 10 expected models load correctly
✅ Model display names properly formatted
✅ No syntax errors in registry.js

### Controller Test
✅ No syntax errors in controller.js
✅ Proper variable scoping
✅ Context notes parsing works correctly

### Frontend Test
✅ No ESLint errors in AIAssistant.jsx
✅ Dependencies installed successfully

## Model Display Names

The following model names will appear in the AI Assistant dropdown:

| Model ID | Display Name |
|----------|-------------|
| gpt-4o | Gpt 4o |
| gpt-4o-mini | Gpt 4o Mini |
| gpt-5 | Gpt 5 |
| o1-mini | O1 Mini |
| llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct | Llama 3.2 90b Vision Instruct |
| llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct | Llama 3.2 11b Vision Instruct |
| mistral-large-2411 | Mistral Large 2411 |
| mistral-small | Mistral Small |
| mistral-nemo | Mistral Nemo |
| phi-4 | Phi 4 |

## Feature Parity with LongCat/Gemini

GitHub Models now have the same features as LongCat and Gemini models:

✅ **System Instruction**: Isabella personality and context
✅ **Context Notes**: Selected notes are sent as context to the AI
✅ **Chat History**: Last 10 messages included in conversation
✅ **File Support**: Vision-capable models can process images

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Important**: The following models have been removed and will no longer be available:
- All Claude models
- All Google Gemini models (still available as legacy models)
- Most Llama 3.x variants (kept only 3.2 vision models)
- All Cohere models
- All AI21 Labs models
- Older Phi models

Users who were using these models will need to select one of the 10 working models.

## Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. ✅ Update backend registry with hardcoded models
2. ✅ Add context notes support
3. ✅ Add system instruction
4. ✅ Update frontend to send context notes
5. ✅ Test all changes
6. ⏳ Deploy and verify in production environment

## Files Modified

1. `backend/github-models/registry.js` - Model list updated
2. `backend/github-models/controller.js` - Context notes and system instruction added
3. `src/components/AIAssistant/AIAssistant.jsx` - Context notes sent to API
