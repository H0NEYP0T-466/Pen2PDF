## Testing Results

### ✅ All Tests Passed

1. **Model Registry Test**
   - ✓ 10 models loaded successfully
   - ✓ All models have correct display names
   - ✓ All models have valid providers

2. **File Policy Test**
   - ✓ Vision capabilities correctly identified
   - ✓ gpt-4o: Vision ✓
   - ✓ o1-mini: No vision
   - ✓ llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct: Vision ✓
   - ✓ mistral-small: No vision

3. **Integration Test**
   - ✓ Model count: 10
   - ✓ GPT-5 included
   - ✓ Vision model count: 5
   - ✓ All have display names
   - ✓ All have valid providers

4. **Code Quality Test**
   - ✓ No syntax errors
   - ✓ ESLint passed
   - ✓ Code review feedback addressed

## Files Modified

1. `backend/github-models/registry.js` - Model list updated
2. `backend/github-models/controller.js` - Context notes and system instruction added
3. `src/components/AIAssistant/AIAssistant.jsx` - Context notes sent to API
4. `AI_ASSISTANT_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md` - Documentation added

## Breaking Changes

⚠️ **Users who were using removed models will need to select a new model from the available list.**

The following models are no longer available via GitHub Models:
- Claude models (use legacy Gemini models instead)
- Older Llama models (use 3.2 vision models)
- Cohere, AI21 Labs models (use OpenAI or Mistral models)

## Migration Guide

For users of removed models:

| Old Model | Recommended Replacement |
|-----------|------------------------|
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | gpt-4o or mistral-large-2411 |
| Llama 3.1 70b | llama-3.2-90b-vision-instruct |
| Llama 3.1 8b | llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct |
| Cohere Command-R | mistral-large-2411 |
| Phi-3.x | phi-4 |

## Implementation Status

- [x] Update registry.js with hardcoded model list
- [x] Remove model discovery functionality
